    "Robotics is moving to the cloud, and there is a big need for web-based tooling. By creating custom plugins for the Jupyter ecosystem we aim to fill this void. We show examples of how we have extended JupyterLab with custom extensions to give it the ability to remote-control real robots, inspect logs from the robots, and analyze recorded data. With these developments, Jupyter can be a cornerstone"

The entire process of robot initialization, parameter tuning and remote supervision of one or multiple robots can be done from the flexible and powerful JupyterLab interface. Additionally we will demonstrate package & environment management using the conda packages for ROS and our speedy mamba installer that runs even on restricted hardware. And of course we will have live demos of our robots!"
